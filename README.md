In this assignment, I took the provided code and fleshed out a function to take several user inputs and pass that information to another
function that would take that information and randomly generate a password. The provided code then lists that password out to 
be seen by the user. The user can choose how long the password will be (between 8 and 128 characters) and what types of characters the
password generator will use (special characters, numbers, lower or uppercase letters). There is an added while loop to insure that the
user enters valid criteria for creating the password.
